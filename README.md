# Analysis of Biodiversity using proportional species richness

## 1. Introduction
<p align="justify">
The document provides data on biodiversity measures for seven taxonomic groups. The 
biodiversity measure used in this analysis is the mean of the proportional species values for 
the seven allocated taxonomic groups (BD7). The authors also provided the mean of all 11 
taxonomic group proportional species values (BD11) as a point of comparison.
The analysis presented in this document provides insights into the biodiversity measures for 
the seven taxonomic groups, which can inform conservation efforts and policy decisions 
aimed at protecting and preserving these ecosystems.
